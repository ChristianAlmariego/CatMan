(A) Spacing Intervals - Maximum. Conductors in vertical raceways shall be supported if the vertical rise exceeds the values in Table 300.19(A). One cable support shall be provided at the top of the vertical raceway or as close to the top as practical. Intermediate supports shall be provided as necessary to limit supported conductor lengths to not greater than those specified in Table 300.19(A). For example, a 10-story building contains a vertical conduit run from the basement to the top floor, approx. 34 m (110 ft) in length. The raceway contains 4/0 copper conductors. Per Table 300.19(A), the unsupported cable length cannot exceed 25 m (80 ft). Therefore, one cable support is required at or near the top of the vertical riser, and one intermediate support is required at or near the midpoint in the conduit run, assuring that any unsupported cable length does not exceed 25 m (80 ft)",Two basic types of cable supports are offered for use with non-armored cable. They both utilize the pOZi-grip&#8482; wedging plug. pOZi-grip&#8482; is a unique manufacturing technique for lining the cable grooves with a coarse grain grit using a high strength epoxy adhesive. This grit improves the cable support holding power and does not injure the jacket or insulation on the cable,"One Piece Plug Type ""S"" consists of a metal body having an insulating liner with a knurled and tapered inside surface and a one piece impregnated hardwood wedging plug having a groove for each wire. This type support is recommended for use with all types of non-armored cables 600 Volts or less, as it is the easiest to install, impossible to install incorrectly and it provides ventilation of the conduit. This design is used in our Types S and D Cable Supports","Multiple Segment Plug Type ""R"" consists of an all metal body having a tapered inner surface and a canvas bakelite multiple segment wedging plug so constructed that each cable is supported between grooves in adjacent segments. This construction provides the uniform pressure distribution required by the softer types of insulations frequently used at higher voltages. This design is used in non-ventilating types R, DR, W, C, K and M, and Ventilating Compound Types CMT, and V",,,,,,,,,Access Portal,http://www.emersonindustrial.com/en-US/egselectricalgroup/Pages/eBusinessLogin.aspx,Members Only Access for our Sales Representatives and Authorized Distributors.,Contact Local Partner,http://www.emersonindustrial.com/en-US/egselectricalgroup/aboutus/wheretobuy/Pages/wheretobuy.aspx,"Search tool to find your local Sales Representative, Distributor, Wholesaler, or Retailer.",Contact Support,http://www.emersonindustrial.com/en-US/egselectricalgroup/aboutus/contactus/Pages/aboutus.aspx,Our Customer Service and Technical Support teams are available to answer your questions.,,NEC/CEC Certifications and Compliances,Listed for Ordinary Locations,Types S and D Standard Materials and Finishes,Hot dip galvanized malleable or ductile iron body with pOZi-grip plug,"Types R, DR, W, C, K and M, CMT, V Materials and Finishes",Molded canvas bakelite bodies; pOZigrip plug; steel/zinc plated steel band; stainless steel bolts and nuts,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,S-1500-B0 | S-2000-B0 | S-2500-B0 | S-3000-B0 | S-3500-B0 | S-4000-B0 | S-5000-B0 | S-6000-B0 | R-1501-B0 | R-2001-B0 | R-2501-B0 | R-3001-B0 | R-3501-B0 | R-4001-B0 | R-5001-B0 | R-6001-B0 | CMT-2000-B0 | CMT-2500-B0 | CMT-3000-B0 | CMT-3500-B0 | CMT-4000-B0 | CMT-5000-B0 | CMT-6000-B0 S-1500-BO | S-2000-BO | S-2500-BO | S-3000-BO | S-3500-BO | S-4000-BO | S-5000-BO | S-6000-BO | R-1501-BO | R-2001-BO | R-2501-BO | R-3001-BO | R-3501-BO | R-4001-BO | R-5001-BO | R-6001-BO | CMT-2000-BO | CMT-2500-BO | CMT-3000-BO | CMT-3500-BO | CMT-4000-BO | CMT-5000-BO | CMT-6000-BO | RPLG-2001-1 | RPLG-2001-2 | RPLG-2501-1 | RPLG-2501-2 | RPLG-3001-1 | RPLG-3001-2 | RPLG-3501-1 | RPLG-3501-2 | RPLG-4001-1 | RPLG-4001-2 | RPLG-5001-1 | RPLG-5001-2 | RPLG-6001-1 | RPLG-6001-2 | V-2005-1 | V-2005-2 | V-2005-BO | V-2505-1 | V-2505-2 | V-2505-BO | V-3005-1 | V-3005-2 | V-3005-BO | V-3505-1 | V-3505-2 | V-3505-B0 | V-3505-BO | V-4005-1 | V-4005-2 | V-4005-B0 | V-4005-BO | V-5005-1 | V-5005-2 | V-5005-B0 | V-5005-BO | V-6005-1 | V-6005-2 | V-6005-BO | C-2004-BO | C-2504-BO | C-3004-BO | C-3504-BO | C-4004-BO | C-5004-BO | C-6004-BO | K-1503-BO | K-2003-BO | K-2503-BO | K-3003-BO | K-3503-BO | K-4003-BO | K-5003-BO | K-6003-BO | M-1520-BO | M-2025-BO | M-2530-BO | M-3035-BO | M-3540-BO | M-4050-BO | M-5060-BO | V-6005-B0 | C-2004-B0 | C-2504-B0 | C-3004-B0 | C-3504-B0 | C-4004-B0 | C-5004-B0 | C-6004-B0 | K-1503-B0 | K-2003-B0 | K-2503-B0 | K-3003-B0 | K-3503-B0 | K-4003-B0 | K-5003-B0 | K-6003-B0 | M-1520-B0 | M-2025-B0 | M-2530-B0 | M-3035-B0 | M-3540-B0 | M-4050-B0 | M-5060-B0 | W-1508-1-LS | W-1508-1-OS | W-1508-1-0S | W-1508-2-LS | W-1508-2-OS | W-1508-2-0S | W-2008-1-LS | W-2008-1-OS | W-2008-1-0S | W-2008-2-LS | W-2008-2-OS | W-2008-2-0S | W-2508-1-LS | W-2508-1-OS | W-2508-1-0S | W-2508-2-LS | W-2508-2-OS | W-2508-2-0S | W-3008-1-LS | W-3008-1-OS | W-3008-1-0S | W-3008-2-LS | W-3008-2-OS | W-3008-2-0S | W-3508-1-LS | W-3508-1-OS | W-3508-1-0S | W-3508-2-LS | W-3508-2-OS | W-3508-2-0S | W-4008-1-LS | W-4008-1-OS | W-4008-1-0S | W-4008-2-LS | W-4008-2-OS | W-4008-2-0S | W-5008-1-LS | W-5008-1-OS | W-5008-1-0S | W-5008-2-LS | W-5008-2-OS | W-5008-2-0S | W-6008-1-LS | W-6008-1-OS | W-6008-1-0S | W-6008-2-LS | W-6008-2-OS | W-6008-2-0S | G-04S | G-04S | G-22S | G-24S | G-25S | PK-200 | F-3020 | F-4030 | F-5040 | F-6050 | FS-0720 | FS-0830 | FS-0940 | FS-1050 | FT-3020 | FT-4030 | FT-5040 | FT-6050 | SF1773-L4050 | SF1773-L4060 ,,,,,,,,,,Ordinary (Unclassified) Locations,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,UL | CSA,,,,,,,,,,"1-1/2"" thru 6""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Hot Dip Galvanized,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Malleable Iron | Ductile Iron | Bakelite,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Cable Support,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,FALSE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The watertight blockage is accomplished by specially designed fins cast on the outside of the fitting body, which permit the concrete, when it cures, to shrink around these fins and prevent water from creeping along the outside of the body","Provide a pressure seal between the fitting body and the outside diameter of any round casing penetrating a wall, floor or ceiling. Pressure sealing is based on an engineering principle that solid rubber-like materials are incompressible. If properly selected material is confined and is compressed, the material will flow to fill all voids, providing a very effective, long lasting seal. The sealing grommet is a shock absorber between the fitting and the casing. It allows axial movement of the casing, removing stresses from the casing. The PVC coated steel rings provide cathodic protection as it insulates the sealing fitting from the casing",Type FSK and WSK thru wall sealing fittings are used where a single casing penetrates the fitting. The FSC and WSC thru wall sealing fittings are used where multiple casings penetrate through one fitting,"The Type FSK and Type FSC fittings are used for most sealing applications. They consist of a body and sealing assembly located on the inside of the structure, and an oversize sleeve which extends from the fitting to the outside of the structure wall. After the foundation is poured, the concrete forms are removed and the round casing is inserted into the body, providing a pressure-tight seal between the round casing and the body of the fitting. The sealing assembly is always available on the inside of the structure for retightening, in the event that sufficient tightening was not utilized during the initial installation",The WSK and the WSC fittings are the same as the Type FSK and FSC fittings except that they have a body and sealing assembly on both sides of the oversize sleeve. This provides a pressure seal on both sides of the wall. The Type WSK and WSC fittings can be used on applications where a seal is required on each side of the wall. The body and sealing assembly on the outside of the wall can also be used as a throttle to limit the pressure on the sealing assembly on the inside of the structure. This practice is used where applications require future provisions for replacing the inside sealing assembly when there is a high pressure on the outside wall,Another purpose for the Type WSK?and WSC fitting is to keep the round casing in the center of the fitting and not have it deflect in the oversize sleeve in the event of earth movement in the back fill,Sealing grommets have an expected life in excess of 20 years,"The steel pressure ring is closely sized to fitting the inside diameter and outside diameter of the casing. It has a PVC coating that provides an insulation between the sealing assembly, and the casing to provide cathodic protection by eliminating stray electrical currents from flowing between the fitting and the casting (exception: multi-hole Type FSC/WSC sealing assemblies furnished with low water-absorbing high-impact thick phenolic plates in electrical applications)",Oversize sleeves have a marker strip to facilitate field-cutting of sleeves to accommodate walls or floors of varying thicknesses,Blank fittings are intended for use as abandonment plugs and for sealing openings reserved for future use.
